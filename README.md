  - 3.1 while-loop.py
    - use of break, continue, else (controls) in while loop
4. CH04 = Functions
  - 4.1 call-by-val-ref.py
    - string, list eg with call by value and call by ref
  - 4.2 args-function.py
    - (*args) using in function for multiple arguments = same as list
  - 4.3 kwargs-function.py
    - (**kwargs) keyword arguments = same as dict
  - 4.4 generators.py
    - use of inclusive_range as compare to range and use of generator in that (yield)
  - 4.5 
    - decorators.py = using of wrappers around a function, small eg
    - decorator-eg.py = a eg with time function using as an wrapper function
5. CH05 = Structured Data

    - index, append, insert, pop, del, slice, join, len
  - 5.2 dict.py
    - print k, v / print using index, print keys , print values
  - 5.3 set-op.py
    - set operation = & , | ,^ , - , sorted
  - 5.4 list-comprehension
    - use of print function separately, list-comprehension with = normal seq, if, tuple, func, dict, set
  - 5.5 mixed.py
    - mix of all the structured data and with diff print functions for all the data types
 6. CH06 = Classes
  - 6.1 constructor.py
    - use of normal method as well as with **kwargs method
  - 6.2 methods.py
    - use of getter and setter in same method and use of specail function = __str__ to remove the previous print() we have
  - 6.3 variables.py
    - use of encapsulation and how object var differ from class var
  - 6.4 
    - inheritance.py = basic inheritance concepts, use of getter and setter , use of super() 
    - reverse-str.py = inheritance concept to reverse the string using str class
  - 6.5 iterator.py
    - use as same as generator function in 4.4 just we have diff functionality of iter, next and constructor
